# Spotify
## Program to add current song to playlist<br>
### This Python script uses the `spotipy` library to interact with the Spotify API.<br> It authenticates the user using `SpotifyOAuth` and retrieves the user's current playback information. <br>If there is a current playback, the script extracts the artist, track name, and album information and adds the track to a specified playlist.<br> If there is no current playback, the script opens an HTML file using `webbrowser`.
